## Comparisons

# = assings
# ex: var = 3 means the variable var is 3

# == compares
# T/F statement
print(3==2)

# != not equal
print (2!=3)

# > Greater than
print (3.2 > 3.1)

# < Less than
print (90 < 90.0001)

# >= Greater than or equal to
print (3.2>= 3.2)

# <= Less than or equal to
print (2<=2.00001)
