##Data Types

#there are numerous data types in programming. Each has it's own purpose and functions use one, some, or all data types

#in VS Code each data type is color coded

#string In any computer programming language, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text
#string is noted by "" or ''

print("The cowboy told the barkeep 'ther's a snake in my boot' ")

#will fail
#print('I'm on my cowular phone ordering tickets for the moovies')

#quote within a string you can use """ """

print(""" The student quoted their teacher saying " my old teacher told us 'don't not use double negatives' """)

#string are color coded

#Integers

#don't use commas
#uses less space in memory
#can do math with integers
print(9*245)
print (838-999)

#Floats
#number with decimal (up to 6 decimal points)
#can do math on floats
print (2.5*3)

#values will start to get rounding errors
print (8.3 * 33)

#can round to a decimal using round function
#round(number, numberOfDecimals)

print(round(3.92933, 2))

#Boolean
#True of False
print(10 > 1)
print (10 < 1)

#function type() will tell you what a variable is
type(1) #will not tell you anything because 
print(type(1))
