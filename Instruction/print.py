##print string
#print("This is my first sentence")

##print numbers
#print(123)

#print(2+3)
#print(5*4)

#blank
#print()

#Print is a function, to activate a function () must always be added
#function is a block of code that runs ONLY when it's called
#putting entries (arguments/parameters) into the () is what's passed into the function

#Print is an overloaded function, meaning it can accepts different semantics as in strings, integers, math, variables themselves and it will process it

## multiple args
#print("test 123", "456", "789")

#string them together
#print("test 123" + "456" + "789")

#notice the difference, multiple args row 19, concatenating in row 22
# concatenate - link (things) together in a chain or series

##string and number
#print("The number of countries is : " + 195)
#^ will fail

#print("The number of countries is:", 195)
