    # input received values from command lines and stores as a varaible


#print("what's your favorite game?: ")
#favGame = input()
#print("Really? you like " + favGame)

#As mentioned functions can take arguments, input accepts 1 argument, a prompt message, this will reduce the lines of code

#favMovie = input("what's your favorite movie?: ")
#print("Heh, nice " + favMovie)
